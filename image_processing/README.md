# TDT4195 - Visual Computing Fundamentals - Image processing part

Assignment 1 is about image processing with filters/kernels and basic neural network image classification over the MNIST dataset.

Assignment 2 is about classifying images with CNNs and image filtering in the frequency domain.

Assignment 3 explores how we can segment an image into foreground and background by using basic segmentation algorithms, such as thresholding and region growing. It also expolores how we can use binary morphological operations to manipulate the contents of a binary image.
